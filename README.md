I've made this little project in order to show up some of my software engineering and Java skills.
You may notice the solution is probably overly complicated for such a simple problem, but I did it so for a couple of reasons. First of all, I wanted to feel challenged and to show some clean code skills. Moreover, I wanted it to be flexible.

I tried to dissociate every criteria in a way that we can easily turn off just one of them (or add some more).
I tried to keep the system as flexible as possible, so that we can, for example, easily deal with a change in requirements.

Since performance is not a main concern for this exercise, I took the freedom to not be so concerned about it.
